## Overview
Iron deficiency is one of the most common micronutrient deficiencies worldwide, often leading to anemia, fatigue, and cognitive impairments. Traditional diagnostic methods typically require blood tests, which can be inaccessible, costly, and time-consuming.  

This project explores the use of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to analyze **visual cues** (nail health, eye appearance, tongue discoloration) that may correlate with iron deficiency. The goal is to create a **non-invasive, low-cost diagnostic tool** that could eventually be deployed through a mobile app.

## Methods
- Built CNN models in Python/Google Colab.  
- Trained on visual datasets of nails, eyes, and tongue images.  
- Preprocessing included resizing, normalization, and augmentation.  
- Evaluated model performance on classification accuracy and early detection capability.  

---

## Current Status
- Baseline CNN model trained and tested in Google Colab.  
- Exploring improved preprocessing and model architectures.  
- Future direction: deployment as a lightweight mobile application for early screening.
